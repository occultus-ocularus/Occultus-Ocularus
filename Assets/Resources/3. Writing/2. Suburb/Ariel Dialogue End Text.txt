ARIEL: Well? How is it, seeing the world in multiple layers?
Do you feel acquainted with your new powers?
|
It's actually impressive how fast you're mastering
your abilities. You're a natural! A genius, some would
even say.
|
{Player grows new set of eyes, on knees}
|
And look! You're already ascending!
|
{Samson appears}
|
SAMSON: Look at you, growing up so fast. You're like a mini-me.
I think I'm gonna tear up.
|
ARIEL: Don't mind him; grow at your own pace. There's no
need to rush.
|
SAMSON: Well, I'm rushing you. At this rate, you'll quickly
graduate from Apprentice and maybe even surpass
me. Hell, you might... you might even reach the Order.
|
ARIEL: He's talking about the Ocular Order. They're the
greatest of us. They're the strongest, the smartest,
the Enlightened.
|
SAMSON: Please. Those fools trip over one another trying to
get things done. I wouldn't be surprised if one of them
shoots their own foot with their laser eyes one day.
|
ARIEL: Samson, don't call them fools. You used to be one of
them. Why you gave all that up, I'll never understand.
It'd be an honor to be a part of the Order.
|
SAMSON: There's nothing to understand. Just because you want
to be part of the Order doesn't mean you can.
|
SAMSON: What makes you think you can ascend to the Order
when you've been stuck as Priestess for decades?
|
ARIEL: That's- That's not fair.
|
SAMSON: God didn't make life fair. He may have created us
Oculi, but Ascension is all up to us and our actions.
|
ARIEL: But I've given everything, done everything I could to
ascend, and yet nothing's changed.
|
SAMSON: Well, that's the problem, isn't it? You're putting in too
much effort.
|
Oh, and kid?
|
I'm looking forward to seeing how far you can go.
Maybe, just maybe... Hmm...
|
Don't let me down, kid.
|
{Samson disappears}
|
ARIEL: ...What is that supposed to mean...?
